# Discord Game SDK for Python

This is **not** a module (for an installable module, check out [LennyPhoenix's fork](https://github.com/LennyPhoenix/py-discord-sdk)).
This was made for **Python >= 3.5** and **Discord Game SDK 3.2.0**

This is a **Work In Progress:** it might not work as expected or not work at all. This was made for testing purposes.

You can also **report issues**. Just open an issue and I will look into it!

## Examples

You can find more examples in the `examples/` directory.

Create a Discord instance

```python
from discord import Discord
from discord.enum import CreateFlags
import time

app = Discord(APPLICATION_ID, CreateFlags.Default)

# Don't forget to call RunCallbacks
while 1:
    time.sleep(1/10)
    app.RunCallbacks()
```

Get current user

```python
from discord import Discord
from discord.enum import CreateFlags
import time

app = Discord(APPLICATION_ID, CreateFlags.Default)

userManager = app.GetUserManager()
def onCurrUserUpdate():
    user = userManager.GetCurrentUser()
    print(f"Current user : {user.Username}#{user.Discriminator}")
    
userManager.OnCurrentUserUpdate = onCurrUserUpdate

# Don't forget to call RunCallbacks
while 1:
    time.sleep(1/10)
    app.RunCallbacks()
```

Set activity

```python
from discord import Discord
from discord.model import Activity
from discord.enum import Result, CreateFlags
import time

app = Discord(APPLICATION_ID, CreateFlags.Default)

activityManager = app.GetActivityManager()

activity = Activity()
activity.State = "Testing Game SDK"
activity.Party.Id = "my_super_party_id"
activity.Party.Size.CurrentSize = 4
activity.Party.Size.MaxSize = 8
activity.Secrets.Join = "my_super_secret"

def callback(result):
    if result == Result.Ok:
        print("Successfully set the activity!")
    else:
        raise Exception(result)
        
activityManager.UpdateActivity(activity, callback)

# Don't forget to call RunCallbacks
while 1:
    time.sleep(1/10)
    app.RunCallbacks()
```
